I love Theta Tau. It is why I came to school at the University of Arizona. I came from a broken home. I have always struggled through life. As the son of the richest people in the Midwest, I was not loved enough. Honestly, it’s a miracle I was conceived. My friends would always ask if I wished they were still married but I couldn’t picture them together so that was always a quick and easy, no. The ability to mediate. I was always the go-between for my parents who refused to speak to each other. I have intimacy and abandonment issues. The intimacy thing isn’t just with men, it’s with friends and family too! Everyone always leaves me so I don’t get close or open myself up to people. I’m very secretive over trivial things because I’ve made a habit of protecting myself above all else. I always plan my escape route. The hardest part about coming from a broken home isn’t that your parents aren’t in love anymore. The hardest part is that it’s not about you. When I say not about you, I mean nothing, nada. Even things you would think should be about you like your schedule, your school lunch money, your clothes, your extracurricular activities – they’re not about you, they’re all about the other parent. I felt like my parents spent more time trying to get back at one another, or jab each other, than actually tend to my needs. Being an only child only amplified the situation.
