I love Theta Tau. It is why I came to school at the University of Arizona. I came from a broken home. I have always struggled through life. As the son of the richest people in the Midwest, I was not loved enough. Honestly, it’s a miracle I was conceived. My friends would always ask if I wished they were still married but I couldn’t picture them together so that was always a quick and easy, no.
