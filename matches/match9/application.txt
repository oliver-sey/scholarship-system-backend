When did you start vaping?
When I was 17 years old. I actually switched from smoking to vaping.
Why do you want to quit vaping?
It is not good for my lungs. And cigarettes taste better.
Do you really think cigs are a better option?
Well not really, but I like them.
Why did you transfer to the UofA?
It was cheaper than the other school I attended.
No seriously, why in the world did you come here?
I really love palm trees and parties.
