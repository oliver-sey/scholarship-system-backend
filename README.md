In Fall 2023, by Anna Fravel, Katelyn McLean, Oliver Seymour, Juliette Nevarez, and MiLee Vogel.

# **Put a summary of the code here:**


# **Put background info of the code and why we did stuff (big picture stuff) here:**


# Details of the data import files:

## In the Scholarship folder:
Each scholarship has its own folder within 'Scholarship', and within that there are 4 text files with information about the scholarship.

### Scholarship Details File (details.txt):
There is one property per line. In order, they are:
Name, description, donor name, award amount, isApproved, isArchived, dateAdded, and dateDue.
The two dates are in the format YYYY-MM-DD, and they eventually get parsed into LocalDate objects. (This is the format that LocalDate.parse(String) accepts).

### Scholarship Application File (applicants.txt):
Like the other files, there is one property per line. They will be Question1, Question2, etc.

### Scholarship Requirements File (requirements.txt):
Like the other files, there is one property per line. They will be Category1, desired value 1 (the value for Category1), Category2, desired value 2, etc.
There has to be an equal number of categories and values, each category needs a value.

If a category accepts multiple values, i.e., you want to allow students from multiple different majors to apply to this scholarship, then you should do Major (newline) major1, and then Major (newline) major2, etc. As if each accepted major is a value for a different category.

### Scholarship Applicants File (applicants.txt):
student name 1, student name 2, etc.



## In the Match folder:

### Scholarship Match Info File:
Student name, scholarship name, Match percentage, match index, application status

### Application File:
Question 1, answer 1, question 2, answer2, etc.


## In the Donor folder:

### Donor details:
First name, Last name, username, password

### Scholarships:
Scholarship name 1, scholarship name 2
